**DES_IDOL_Project**

This is the final year IDOL project

DES (Data encryption standard) Therory overview 
1. DES use for data encryption and decryption purpose.
2. DES developed by IBM in 1970
3. DES take 64 bit plain text and convert into 64 bit encyption text is called as chipertext.
4. DES use single key for both encyption and decryption process of data.
5. split the right text and left text, 16 round process perform & show the output.
6. After 16 round process joined together and produced the 64 bit chiper text.
7. There are 2 types of DES

   I. Double DES
   II. Triple DES

8. Double DES use 2 key for encyption and decryption the data 
   first key for encypt the data and second key use for decypt the data.
9. Triple DES use 3 key for encyption and decryption the data
   first key use for encypt the data, second key use for decrypt the data, third key use for again encypt the data.

2. In this project there are 3 class .java file and 1 htm file index.html 

- DESEncryption.java   
- EncryptionApplication.java
- EncryptionController.java
- index.html

3. index.html file deploy on under templete 

4. below is the file system strcuture for your refrence
